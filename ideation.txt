model real life probabilistically using functions
Example: a function of the person's health and happiness and age that lead to chance of person falling sick on a particular day
UI: see overview of their statistics, also able to choose actions to perform (which affects stats)
World Editor (for functions) / Play mode 
World Editor: input variables(stats), functions(control stats), text results, text choice --> text results
Every day, person choose what to do 
Probabilistically come up with events that happen throughout the day.
